# Relocation_Recommender_System
Recommending zip codes in a relocation city based on similarity to previous home zip code

When relocating to a new city, it is often difficult to determine where to live that will have a similar feel to home. Relocation families, know as "relos" in the real estate brokerage industry, often struggle to narrow down towns and wind up looking at homes in many very different communities. Families are often uprooted and are looking for a sense of stability and community. They often have limited time to make a decision and view homes, and end up making a hasty decision. The goal of this project is to build a recommender system that recommends a particular zip code near or in the city that the individual or family is looking to move to that will feel most like home. This tool will be helpful not only for moving families but for real estate agents looking to narrow down locations to show properties.

Data will come from the following sources:

The 5-Year American Community Survey, which includes information about people and housing characteristics (census.gov)
Greatschools.org - School ratings
ZipCode Business Patterns (also from census.gov)
Redfin data, such as sales price
